This is a project I am using to coincide with a series of Medium blog posts "Getting Started with Mapbox GL JS". Feel free to check out the first article here, https://medium.com/swlh/getting-started-with-react-and-mapbox-gl-js-daa96477dd2c. I also have the following series linked in the article.

Purpose:
I love maps. I love looking at them, and I had heard MapBox is amazing, allows a ton of customization and added features. It was a no brainer, I wanted to learn it. So I figured I would document my learning through blog posts, post it's coinciding project on Github for you to play around with and add to, so that you could learn MapBox too.

In it we use MapBox GL JS open source mapping software to perform some beginning tasks. Such as how to set this map up, how to set a users location on button click, how to at points onto the map.

Development:
MapBox Demo use React and MapBox GL JS API (which requires an account and token)

Feel free to download, run and make your own edits.

1. Go to mapbox, create and download your own token (it's free).
2. Clone repo to local
3. NPM install
4. Past your token into the <ReactMapGL> tag as a value in the key mapboxApiAccessToken.
5. NPM start to view in the browser.

To Do's:
Next we are going to add points from an API! Possibly adjust size and add styling.
